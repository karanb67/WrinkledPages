                  From the owners:  <br><br>

                  “I have been reading from a young age. I have read at every stage of my life and there has never been a time when I have not enjoyed it. I feel they are the most diligent teachers and pedantic counselors who help you throughout your life. They are the nicest friend, quietest and faithful. I feel the joy, the peace in reading and wanted to divvy up the joy with others. I trust the readers to help me grow the WrinkledPages family." <br>Karan
                    <br><br>
                  “My passion for reading roots from my curious neural wiring that viscerally relates non-fictitious and fictitious world resulting into a genial interdisciplinary approach. Over the years I have made myself a mini library in my house. For me books are a narcotic. I believe this avenue has many sparkling domains to offer at its resort for the readers and also for the sellers. Like Erasmus said- When I have a little money, I buy books; and if I have left any then I buy food and clothes.”-Karan Kathuria  <br><br>
